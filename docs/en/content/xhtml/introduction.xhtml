    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Migrants who enter, stay or work in a country without the necessary authorization or valid documents are
        irregular migrants. Criminal organisations that smuggle migrants are motivated by greed and profit, not the
        welfare of the migrant and risk the lives of irregular migrants. Irregular and smuggled migrants face an
        increased risk to becoming victims of human trafficking. Many thousands of smuggled migrants die tragically
        each year.</p>

    <p>As a frontline law enforcement officer you may encounter irregular migrants or migrants being smuggled or
        trafficked. You will need to be able to distinguish between these cases in order to respond appropriately.</p>

    <p>You should carry this guide with you while you are on duty. It contains quick-reference tools to address
        situations you will likely experience in the course of your duty. .</p>
