    <p>You may find yourself operating in rural, urban or maritime environments, which will present different
        challenges and potential hazards. Take into account the safety of the investigators, suspects, and potential
        victims when planning operations. Raids and rescues are high-risk operations that should be a last option and
        conducted after systematic risk assessment and planning. While planning, considering the following points.</p>

    <h6>Information</h6>
    <p>
        Describe everything the team needs to know about the operation, including suspected offences.</p>

    <h6>Intention</h6>
    <p>
        What do you want your investigation to achieve?</p>

    <h6>Method</h6>
    <p>
        How are you going to achieve it? Think of resources needed, separate transportation for suspected smugglers,
        traffickers, and victims, and preparing medical care.</p>

    <h6>Administration</h6>
    <p>
        Consider all the logistical details necessary, such as timing, meals, support staff to deal with multiple
        suspected smugglers, traffickers, and victims, as well as media.</p>

    <h6>Risk Assessment</h6>

        Conduct a risk assessment as per Section 7 on Assessing Risks in this field guide.</p>
