    <h3>22. Interviewing Migrants</h3>
    <img class="rightFloat200" src="../imgs/G07_22.svg"  />

    <p>Before interviewing a migrant, you need to assess their welfare, which includes any requirements for food, water
        or medical treatment. You may also need to arrange an interpreter and, in some cases, a support person.</p>

    <p>The migrant should be treated as a victim, not as a suspect.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Inform the migrants of their legal rights, and ensure that the migrants and their family are not at risk.</li>
        <li>Have a female officer interview female victims or child victims whenever possible. Give the victim an
            opportunity to choose the gender of the interviewing officer.</li>
        <li>Smuggled migrants can be refugees.</li>
        <li>Remember that the victim should give his/her account of what has occurred.</li>
        <li>These questions are not exhaustive and are not in any particular order.</li>
        <li>These questions can be used to identify elements of the account that have not been covered by the migrant
            or that need elaboration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The migrant may dispose of legitimate travel documentation upon reaching their end destination. It is important
        to clarify where the migrant has legally travelled before reaching their destination.</p>

    <h6>Are smuggled migrants referred to as victims?</h6>

    <p>A smuggled migrant is not considered to be a “victim of migrant-smuggling” because, generally, a person consents
        to being smuggled. However, a smuggled migrant may be a victim of other crimes in the course of being smuggled.</p>

    <p>While a migrant is not a victim of migrant smuggling, they can be victims of other crimes as a result of being
        smuggled.</p>

    <h6>Sample Interview Questions for migrants:</h6>

    <ul>
        <li>When did you leave your country?</li>
        <li>Why did you leave your country?</li>

        <li>Where does this person live?</li>
        <li>What travel documents did you use?</li>

        <li>How many smugglers have you met or dealt with on this journey?</li>
        <li>Were there any threats made against you or your family by the smugglers?</li>
        <li>What instructions did the smugglers give</li>
        <li>you during your journey?</li>
        <li>Have you been instructed on what to say to police or immigration officials?</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Guidelines for child migrants</h6>

    <p>Frontline officers must provide assistance and protection for separated or unaccompanied children who are
        outside their country of nationality, regardless of their migration status. Remember that the care and welfare
        of the child is the primary concern.</p>

    <h6>Age</h6>

    <p>A child is a person under the age of 18. Confirm age of the child using nonintrusive, child-friendly measures,
        such as observations of physical, mental and emotional development.</p>

    <h6>Legal Rights</h6>

    <p>Inform the child of their rights in a language they can understand.</p>

    <p>Child rights include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>life</li>
        <li>healthcare</li>
        <li>education</li>
        <li>protection of physical integrity</li>
        <li>not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty</li>
        <li>not be returned to a country where there is a real risk of irreparable harm to the child</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Seek assistance of NGOs to aid in child care, placement and community support.</p>

    <h6>Interviewing</h6>

    <p>As soon as possible, identify, interview and register unaccompanied and separated children in an age-sensitive
        and gender-sensitive manner.</p>

    <p>Child victims and witnesses should not be interviewed where they live.</p>

    <p>Rooms where young children are interviewed should be child-friendly with a few toys.</p>

    <p>The child should be asked basic questions in a language they can understand.</p>

    <p>A support person should be provided for the child. The choice of this person will depend upon the circumstances
        of how the child was smuggled.</p>

    <p>If the child’s account is very brief or where limited information is provided you may wish to consider stopping
        the interview. You may need to review the information you have at a later stage with a prosecutor and the
        child’s caregiver.</p>

    <h6>Separated Child:</h6>

    <p>A child who has been separated from both parents, or from legal or customary primary caregiver, but not
        necessarily from other relatives. This may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult family
        members</p>

    <h6>Unaccompanied Child:</h6>

    <p>A child who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who,
        by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.</p>

    <p>If you suspect that a child has been sexually assaulted and/or molested, the child should NOT be asked to
        demonstrate the act to anyone but medical staff.</p>
