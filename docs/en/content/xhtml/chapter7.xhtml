    <h2>7. Decision Making</h2>

    <p>When you identify a migrant smuggling or human trafficking case, your initial priority should be the welfare of
        the victims. They may be sick or in need of urgent medical attention.</p>

    <p>After you have arranged for the care of the victims, your attention should then focus on gathering evidence to
        identify, and if possible, prosecute the offenders.</p>

    <p>Even if your country has not yet ratified legislation criminalising migrant smuggling, the evidence you gather
        may be of vital importance to foreign law enforcement agencies. The evidence may help identify criminals at
        every stage of the migrantâ€™s journey.</p>

    <p>Assess the welfare of the victims before gathering evidence. Remember they are victims of a crime.</p>
