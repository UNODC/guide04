    <h3>17. Forensic Considerations</h3>

    <p>Many items of evidence can be subject to forensic examination. Consider the following techniques.</p>

    <p><strong>Fingerprints</strong><br />
        Can be found on many objects, including smooth surfaces, paper, and people. If authorised, take the suspect’s
        fingerprints when you arrest them, even if they have been taken before.</p>

    <p><strong>DNA</strong><br />
        Can be taken from people and most animal or plant products. Good sources are blood, hair and other bodily
        fluids.</p>

    <p><strong>Document Examination</strong><br />
        Forensic examination of travel documents, identification cards or birth certificates may reveal that they are
        counterfeits or have been fraudulently altered</p>

    <p><strong>Handwriting Analysis</strong><br />
        Compare the suspect’s handwriting to that found on documents, cheques, notebooks, diaries etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Computer Forensics</strong><br />
        Laptops, SIM cards, portable storage devices and cards may hold valuable evidence of contacts, communications
        or financial information.</p>

    <p>Always seek advice from a forensic specialist</p>
