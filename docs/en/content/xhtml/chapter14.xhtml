<h2>14. Preserving a Crime Scene</h2>

<p>As the first officer at a crime scene, you should take immediate steps to preserve the scene and protect evidence from weather or from contamination.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ensure that no one is hurt and that all suspects have been secured.</li>
	<li>Create a cordon around the scene. A safe bet is to identify what you think is a large enough area, and then double it. It is easier to reduce the size of a crime scene than to expand it.</li>
	<li>Keep crowds or the media out of the crime scene. Establish a crime scene log of anyone entering or leaving the scene and their reasons for doing so.</li>
	<li>Mark out a ‘safe route’ to allow access to the scene, avoiding any paths that may have been used by the suspect.</li>
	<li>If you have to process the scene, take many photographs.</li>
	<li>Make notes of your actions at the scene. Note what you see, hear, touch and, if necessary, smell.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Do not allow unnecessary or unauthorised people into the scene.</li>
	<li>Consider how to preserve the scene to prevent weather damage.</li>
	<li>Beware of safety hazards at the scene, such as diseases.</li>
</ul>
