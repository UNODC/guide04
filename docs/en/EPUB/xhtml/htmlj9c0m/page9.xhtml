<h2>6. Sharing Intelligence</h2>

<p>If the intelligence report contains information that may assist a foreign law enforcement agency, then it should be forwarded to your national intelligence unit.</p>

<p>The forwarding agency can search for and enter information into international databases and issue notices and alerts.</p>

<p>The intelligence unit should consider sending such intelligence through foreign liaison officers, or international or regional mechanisms (BLO).</p>

<p>Field officers should complete an intelligence report and submit it to national or regional HQ</p>

<p>Upon receipt of intelligence, the receiving HQ will disseminate the intelligence to the appropriate agency for action.</p>
